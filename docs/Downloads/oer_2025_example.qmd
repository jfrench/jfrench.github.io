![Who is this?](pic.png){width=120% fig-align="center" fig-alt="Alf is great!." #fig-alf}

We can see in @fig-alf how handsome Alf is.

## Subsection 2

Our second subsection.

A simple linear regression model is often written as
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon.
$$ {#eq-slr}

We refer to @sec-section1 for a great introduction.

@eq-slr uses mathematical notation to describe a simple linear regression model.

@sp2005 wrote a nice book.
