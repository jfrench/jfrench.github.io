:::{#jfrench-heading}

I am a statistician and data scientist. I am currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences at the University of Colorado Denver. I am passionate about using statistics and data science to learn from data, developing software to help others learn from data, and training others to do data analysis.
